Hello, and welcome to your first cloned Repository. 
You must be pretty smart to have made it this far. 
In this Forked repository are a series of tasks you'll have to finish before you head out of class today. 
They are outlined BELOW:
DO NOT SKIP AHEAD. 

Must Do's
    Quick Warmup
    Command Line Practice Exercises
    X Marks the Spot Game

Quick Warmup: Below are 5 tasks, read through each task and take note of what you're doing.
When typing in the commands, ignore the "" 
Correct: pwd
Incorrect: "pwd"

1 - Use "pwd" to show the current directory(folder) that you're currently in
    Expected Output: /home/ubuntu/workspace
2 - Use "cd Terminal-Practice" to go into your new forked folder. 
3 - Use "mkdir test" to create a directory called test
4 - Use "cd test" to go into the newly created directory
5 - Use "touch test.txt" to create a new file called test.txt
6 - Use "ls" to see the file you just created.
6 - Use "cd .." to go back into your previous directory 
7 - Use "pwd" to ensure you're in Terminal-Practice
Now you're ready! 

Command Line Practice Exercises - 
In the file tree to the left, are a list of directories (folders) and files. 
Use only Terminal commands and command statements to do the following:
*AGAIN IGNORE THE ""*
1 - Use the "pwd" command to make sure you're in the "Terminal-Practice" directory.
2 - Use the "ls" command to see all the files and directories 
3 - Use "rm -r removeMe.txt" command statement to remove the removeMe.txt file
4 - Use "rm -r removeThisFolder" command statement to remove the removeThisFolder directory
5 - Use the "rm -r removeMeToo.txt" to remove the file
6 - Use "mv renameMe newName" command statement to change the name of the renameMe directory
7 - Use "mv changeMyName.txt changed.txt" command statement to change the name of the changeMyName.txt file
8 - Use "mv movethis.txt newName/" to move the movethis.txt file into the newName directory
9 - Use "touch path.txt" to create a text file named path file
10 - Ok you can use your mouse for only this one though, open the path.txt file you just created by double clicking. 

Whew, I feel the heat from that keyboard. Take a couple seconds, collect your thoughts because you made it here.
Next up, X marks the spot game!

X marks the spot - Locate the findthex directory to your left again. 

1 - Inside thefindthex directory are a series of files and other directories. 
2 - Your task is to locate ONLY the x.txt files. 
3 - Using cd (change directory) or cd .. (go back a previous directory) navigate through until you've found ALL 5 x.txt files. 
4 - Use the ls command to see which files are in the directory. 
5 - When you have found one, use pwd to print the file path of the where the x.txt file resides. 
6 - Then copy and paste the file path into the path.txt file.
